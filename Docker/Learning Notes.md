#Docker

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. It ensures that applications run consistently across different environments.

## Why Use Docker?
- **Portability**: Applications run the same way on any system with Docker installed.
- **Isolation**: Containers keep applications and dependencies separate.
- **Efficiency**: Uses fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Makes it easy to scale applications up or down.
- **Simplified Deployment**: Reduces the "works on my machine" problem.

  ## Containers vs. Virtual Machines
- **Containers** share the host OS kernel but have isolated file systems.
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)** run a full OS inside a hypervisor.
- Containers are **lighter and faster** compared to VMs.

  ## When to Use Which:
**Use Containers** when you need quick startup times, portability, and lightweight resource consumption. Containers are great for microservices, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and scalable, cloud-native applications.

**Use VMs** when you need strong isolation, a full OS, or are running legacy applications that might require a specific OS version or configuration that canâ€™t be easily replicated within a container.
