# Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in DevOps

Terraform is a Infrastruvture as Code (IaC) tool in DevOps to create resources on different Cloud providers and Platforms. IaC is a way of managing and creating computer infrastructures like servers, databases, networks,and storage etc. This is in code form instead of manual which gives us many benifits like storing the code on GitHub, helping with version control and collaboration. We can also scale applications quickly as well as recreate them if there are any issues.

## How it works:

### Configuration Stage  
This is the setup phase. You gather all the necessary tools, resources, and information needed to start the project or task. Think of it as getting everything ready before you begin.

### Planning Stage  
This is where you create a roadmap. You set goals, assign tasks, and decide on timelines. Itâ€™s like making a to-do list and schedule to ensure everything runs smoothly.

### Execution Stage  
This is the action phase. You follow the plan, complete tasks, and solve any issues that arise.
