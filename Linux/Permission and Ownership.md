# üìú 1. Viewing File Permissions

To check file permissions, use:
```sh
ls -l filename
```

Example output:
```sh
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 1234 Feb 15 12:00 myfile.sh
```

### Breakdown:
- `-` : Regular file (or `d` for directory)
- `rwx` : Owner (read, write, execute)
- `r-x` : Group (read, execute)
- `r--` : Others (read only)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Changing Permissions with `chmod`

**Symbolic Mode:**
```sh
chmod u+x script.sh  # Add execute permission to user
chmod g-w file.txt   # Remove write permission from group
chmod o+r file.txt   # Give others read permission
```

**Numeric (Octal) Mode:**
- `7` : Read, Write, Execute (rwx)
- `6` : Read, Write (rw-)
- `5` : Read, Execute (r-x)
- `4` : Read-only (r--)

```sh
chmod 755 script.sh  # rwxr-xr-x (Owner: all, Group: read/execute, Others: read/execute)
chmod 644 file.txt   # rw-r--r-- (Owner: read/write, Group & Others: read)
```

## üë§ 3. Changing Ownership with `chown`

**Change File Owner:**
```sh
chown newuser file.txt
```

**Change File Owner and Group:**
```sh
chown user:group file.txt
```

**Recursively Change Ownership (for directories):**
```sh
chown -R user:group my_directory/
```
